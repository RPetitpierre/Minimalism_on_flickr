\begin{abstract}
  The following paper attempts to determine the possible cultural impact on the interpretations of the artistic movement minimalism in photography. In order to determine the different trends within minimalism and to see if they are culturally specific, the flickr database was used. The corpus included 1'027'777 auto-tagged images, among which 4'356  images were also user-tagged and 193'153 were geolocalized. Based on these tags, the Louvain algorithm was applied to perform communities clustering. The outcome was 5 clusters representing different artistic trends: house and indoor activities, urban and geometry, landscapes, lights and nature.

\section{Introduction}
ACM's consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides a
consistent \LaTeX\ style for use across ACM publications, and
incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality
necessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and
SIG-specific \LaTeX\ templates have been examined, and their unique
features incorporated into this single new template.

If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a valuable
guide to the process of preparing your work for publication. If you
have published with ACM before, this document provides insight and
instruction into more recent changes to the article template.

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can be used to prepare articles
for any ACM publication --- conference or journal, and for any stage
of publication, from review to final ``camera-ready'' copy, to the
author's own version, with {\itshape very} few changes to the source.

\section{Data}
The data used in the context of the project is the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons dataset that can be downloaded via the flickr api at \url{https://www.flickr.com/services/api/}. Each image contains a photo\_id, a jpeg url, a title, a description, a camera type and tags. The corpus thus includes 1'027'777 auto-tagged images, among which 4'356  images are also user-tagged and 193'153 are geolocalized. The dataset also contains time information 99,99\% of the time.

%\subsection{Template Styles}

%The primary parameter given to the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class is
%the {\itshape template style} which corresponds to the kind of publication
%or SIG publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square
%brackets and is a part of the {\verb|documentclass|} command:
%\begin{verbatim}
  %\documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}
%\end{verbatim}

%Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM journals
%use the {\verb|acmsmall|} template style:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item {\verb|acmsmall|}: The default journal template style.
%\item {\verb|acmlarge|}: Used by JOCCH and TAP.
%\item {\verb|acmtog|}: Used by TOG.
%\end{itemize}

%The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use the {\verb|acmconf|} template style.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item {\verb|acmconf|}: The default proceedings template style.
%\item{\verb|sigchi|}: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.
%\item{\verb|sigchi-a|}: Used for SIGCHI ``Extended Abstract'' articles.
%\item{\verb|sigplan|}: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.
%\end{itemize}
